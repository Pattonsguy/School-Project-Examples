# School-Project-Examples
Examples of some code projects that were created during my time at the University of North Florida

Systems Software:
The goal of this project was to create a program in C that could compile SIC and SICXE code into a usable object file.
This project was based on one of the other member's code for a previous project for converting only SIC code into an object file.
We also had to extrapolate information from the documentation and determine how the results should be formatted.
Serves as an example of programming as a team and collaborating through GitHub.
Examples of an input and output are given.

Web Systems:
The goal of this project was to recreate a target website (for my team we chose Matterhackers.com) using C#, HTML, and CSS.
The project was based off of an example project we were given to get acqainted with web development.

Software Engineering:
Our team created a hypothetical crypto wallet tracking and reporting system. My role in this was to create a wallet and transaction generator based in Python. Which the front end would then accept and provide insights to the user.

Intro to AI:
All AI projects utilized Python.
Project 1 - An crash course introduction to Python. We wrote a program that would read off of a supplies CSV file and convert them into a "State" object. The user would then be given several options to view different statistical calculations related to the data.
Project 2 - Tasked with creating generic search algorithms such as Depth First Search, Breadth First Search, Uniform Cost Search, and A star. The autograder provided would reference the methods we were to add our code to.

Operating Systems:
dosinterpreter.c - A program created to work with the linux command line that would take in DOS commands, perform an equivalent linux command in the background, and return the result to the user.
ProducerConsumer.java - A program meant to show off Java multithreading capabilities, a producer and a consumer were put in different scenarios which resulted in overflows, starvation, or perfect production and consumption.
SafeState.java - A program that simulates Bankers algorithm, the given example is coded into the program itself for simplicity. In it's current state it will error out as the example setup cant leave the system in a safe state.
